This is the capstone project repo for a part-time General Assembly course I am taking. I intend to continue improving this project long after it's finished. Both during and after the course, it will go through the following stages:

* Create a simple linear discriminant analysis model that can distinguish if a tweet came from one of two feeds.
* Expand that model to include more training features, and the feeds of all US senators.
* Continue improving the accuracy over time while also developing ways of subverting those techniques as well.

There are numerous ways of testing the accuracy and so many ways of combining various features in various model approaches. This will be an open-ended project that I intended to continue improving until I get too occupied with other things to bother. 

**New additions to this repo will be incoming on a semi-regular basis. The project will be ongoing for several years.**
