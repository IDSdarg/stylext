This is the capstone project repo for a part-time General Assembly course I am taking. I intend to continue improving this project long after it has been submitted for final course review. After the course, it will go through the following stages:

* Create a time-series model that can "fingerprint" user tweet habits (potentially giving away their time zone).
* Expand the entire model to include more training features, and the feeds of all US senators.
* Continue improving the accuracy over time while also developing ways of subverting those techniques as well.

There are numerous ways of testing the accuracy and so many ways of combining various features in various model approaches. This will be an open-ended project that I intended to continue improving until I get too occupied with other things to bother. 

**New additions to this repo will be incoming on a semi-regular basis. The project will be ongoing for several years.**
