I began this project as a capstone for a [General Assembly course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/) I took in the spring of 2016. Work obligations (and the need to keep making minimum payments on a credit card) inhibited me from finishing the project as soon as intended. However, I decided to continue working on it in order to prepare myself for future data science projects/courses. It has served as useful practice for (and demonstration of) data acquisition, pre-processing, and analysis.

I will continue improving this project by experimenting with various machine learning models and ensemble techniques. After the course, it will now go through the following stages:

* Create a time-series model that can "fingerprint" user tweet habits (potentially giving away their time zone).
* Expand the entire model to include more training features, and the feeds of all US senators.
* Continue improving the accuracy over time while also developing ways of subverting those techniques as well.

There are numerous ways of testing the accuracy and so many ways of combining various features in various model approaches. This will be an open-ended project that I intend to continue improving until I get too occupied with other things. 

#### Stages for First Iteration:

* Acquire Tweets using Tweepy API script
* "Fingerprint" feeds using Ipython notebook
* Use logistic regression for Tweet attribution

#### Project Experimentation:

* Different Twitter datasets
* Varied choice of features
* Other attribution models
