# About These CSV Files

&nbsp;

tweets.csv is the only file you need to make use of this repo for now, the other(s) are just to give people an idea of what the next phase of the project will look like when columns will be needed for new features that may distinguish one user from another. This is because obfuscating a writing style is different from attributed authorship alone.

The above has been true ever since a Python 3 update to the repo that took place mid-May of 2018.
