# IPython Notebook File List

&nbsp;

*stylext.ipynb* is the main file of interest. This self-contained notebook can walk you through authorship attribution of two or more twitter feeds. In it's default form it will work with the tweets.csv file in this repo.

I have yet to update the pre-processing notebook file to be Python 3-ready, but for now I intend to keep that in here to give people an idea of what feature extraction may look like when adding obfuscation functionality to stylext as a whole.
